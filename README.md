## UserStories / Requirements 

Goals of the website for the user
    Navigation
    The website has a simple yet structure design so the user does not get lost.
    The navigation bar clearly sets out the direction of the site. The heading of the webpage the user is on will be underlined so the user can keep track of where they are.

    Purpose
    From the onset the page illustrates the purpose of the website. The hero image reflects the nature of the business.
    The about section is short and concise to avoid the user having to read long periods of text. Showing the profile of the team and what they do acquaints the user with who we are as a company.
    The promotion video is used to demonstrate the kind of work we do, and gives the user an insight to what it would be like for their pet.
    
    Contact
    Each of our team profiles have contact details so the user can reach out directly with any queries. The social media links are on the footer of every page, so the user does not need to click back when they want to visit the social media profiles.
    Use of the google image answers the users question of where without them having to ask.
    The sign up page gives the user the opportunity to enter their information to avail of the service.


    Return Users
    A return user can use the page to book in a session and see if there are any updated events.
    The goal would be that the page would update their audience with any new schedules, changes, features and general info about the company.

    DESIGN

    There is a consistent design throughout each webpage. In terms of colour, text, layout, the theme remains the same providing consistency and emphasising the brand of the company.
    There is a slight change of font and colour for the teams profiles. This was to add emphasis to them.
