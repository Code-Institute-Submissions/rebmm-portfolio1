        <h2>Who is Pawkies?</h2>
        
        <p>Pawkies is a family run business, who absolutely adore animals, specifically dogs.<br>
           The family have their own dogs and occasionally would mind dogs of friends and family.<br>
           They noticed in their community their were some people who may not always have the time to walk<br>
           their dogs as much as they should be. There were neighbours who couldn't walk their dogs for various reasons.<br>
           So the idea got put to the test and we started a trial to explore interest in this.<br>
           Since then we have had many people use our service. This has grown and we have a mix of regular visitors and <br>
           always welcome newcomers with open arms, and paws!
